# Start writing your code below
# Lists start at index number 0!
# map is just a variable that contains a nested list. It's not related to the map function in Python.
# Nested lists are accessed from out to in. So if list=[[A,B,C],[E,F,G]] then E = list[1][0]
# Check that you haven't accidentally added extra spaces and the X is a capital X with a single quote around it.
